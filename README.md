# F-Voks

![f-voks](images/f-voks1.png)

The instrument F-Voks (Finger-Voks) is a performative vocal synthesizer by gestural control composed of an interface including two graphic tablets, a base of sound samples of sung disyllables, as well as a synthesis engine functioning by concatenation of sound samples with a vocoder. This instrument allows to generate phonemes, then transformed into voice, from gestures on a graphic tablet and to control the pitch and the vocal effort of the synthesized voice. Vowels are represented by a vowel space (triangle or vowel trapezium) on a surface. The gestures generating the consonants are associations of finger movements.
